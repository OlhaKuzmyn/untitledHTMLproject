    <strong><a href="#rr">Garden roses</a></strong> are predominantly hybrid roses that are grown as ornamental plants in private or public gardens. They
    are one of the most popular and widely cultivated groups of flowering plants, especially in temperate climates. An
    enormous number of garden cultivars have been produced, especially over the last two centuries, though roses have
    been known in the garden for millennia beforehand. While most garden roses are grown for their flowers, often in
    dedicated rose gardens, some are also valued for other reasons, such as having ornamental fruit, providing ground
    cover, or for hedging.
